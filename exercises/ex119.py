#Cats Everywhere
#Let's practice building some objects on our own and using classes. You can find the exercise and solution files attached to this lesson!
# 1 Instantiate the Cat object with 3 cats
# 2 Create a function that finds the oldest cat
# 3 Print out: "The oldest cat is x years old.". x will be the oldest cat age by using the function in #2

class Cat:
    species = 'mammal'
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Instantiate the Cat object with 3 cats
peanut = Cat("Peanut", 3)
garfield = Cat("Garfield", 5)
snickers = Cat("Snickers", 1)


# Find the oldest cat
def get_oldest_cat(*args):
    return max(args)


# Output
print(f"The oldest cat is {get_oldest_cat(peanut.age, garfield.age, snickers.age)} years old.")
